%solution to question no.1
distance = 100/1000;                             % 100 m changed to kilometer/km
time = 9.58 /3600;                               % changing 9.58 sec to hour
hundred = distance / time

%solution to question number two
time_hr = (2*3600+1*60+39)/3600;
distance = 42.195;
marathon = distance/time_hr
